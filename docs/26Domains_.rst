Domains
==========================

*Domains are reusable data definitions that store basic features of a specific control, table field or database column. In this section aims to introduce domains and its usage.*


What is Domain?
---------------

In large business applications, programmers have to use numerous text field, table column instances to store, read and show **same** kind of data for different table and forms. So they have to make same metadata definitions like length, formatters, description texts etc. in different forms and tables. This process dramatically increases mainteance cost, when a widely used type has an new modification. To overcome this kind of situations, we mostly use reusable custom types, components etc.
