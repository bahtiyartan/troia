VisualVM for Optimization and Monitoring

Profiling Tools
-------------

A profiling tool is an optimization tool which is used to determine resource problems about components of the sofware such as which components of software consume the most resources, which functions run the longest, and which processes cause bottlenecks. 

Profiling tools focus primarily on performance analysis and memory management, because the primary bottleneck resources in a software systems are the CPU and memory. So in generalprofiling tools generally do not focus on resources such as disk or network.

Performance and memory analysis are performed to detect and resolve various errors or to optimize problematic parts of the code in terms of processor and memory usage. All profiling tools work for these purposes, however, they vary according to the characteristics and needs of the programming language or platform.

Performance (CPU) Analysis
==========================

Performance analysis is the whole analysis process based on the running time, such as the triggering order of functions within the application, the number of triggers, and the time spent in these functions. It measures the speed of the application and determine its efficiency in terms of processing load.



Memory Analaysis
================

Memory Analysis is the analysis process carried out to measure the memory usage of the application, examine the data held in memory, and detect unnecessary memory usage or memory leaks.
