Basic Java Concepts For TROIA Developers
=========================================

*TROIA Platform works on Java Virtual Machine, so to know about Java saves time in some special cases such as performance optimization, debugging and deployment. This section aims to introduce basic and useful java concepts for troia developers or system administrators.*


What is Java
------------

Java is a simple, high-level, object-oriented, general-purpose programming  language. It works on a virtual machine which is called JVM. So java applications work on anywhere which JVM works on, so it is a "write once, run anywhere" programming language.


Main Advantages
===============

Java offers some economic and technical advantages and all this advantages become a part of the solutions that are devloped with Java. Here are some of the pros of Java programming language.


**Object oriented :** enhances the flexibility and reusability of the code.

**Readible :** it is a high-level programming language, so it is human readible and reduces maintenance costs.

**Platform-independent :** java applications work on anywhere which JVM works on, so they are portable.

**Supports multithreading :** multithreading helps us to gain the maximum utilization of CPU and allows handling larger data and more complex problems in relatively short running time.

**Simple and secure :** Memory management is handled by garbage collector, there is no complex concepts like pointers, it is easy to learn.


Where java codes stored?
========================

Java codes are stored in files which has **.java** extension. These files can be edited via complex IDEs (eclipse,netbeans etc) or simple editors (notepad, vi). In a large application, there can be numerous .java files. After compilation process, .class files are generated.



JVM / JRE / JDK
----------------


JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
===========================

JVM is a kind of native application that interprets .class files for the underlying platform. In other words, it isolates .class file content from the host machine. .class files are loaded by class loader which is subcomponent of the JVM. JVM is a subcomponent of JRE.


JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
==============================

JRE contains Java class libraries, Java virtual machines, and other tools that the programs need to execute. Development tools like compiler and debuggers are not included in JRE. It becomes operational at the moment when the application program is executed.


JDK (Java Development Kit)
===============================
