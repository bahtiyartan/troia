How to Read Version Number?
---------------------------

As an TROIA application developer or system administrator, it is important to know your version number. Because some new features revealed or bugs are fixed with new releases. And you must know whether your version supports the features that you need or all your components have same version to be sure that your installation is valid or not.

You can read your version number on login screen or from about dialog (Menu->About).

Sample version numbers are listed below:

::

	3.08.05 021101 
	5.01.02 012102 
	5.02.04 041201  
	8.02.01 051501   (deprecated format)
	8.03.02 030201   (deprecated format)
	
	8.02 22.02.14-01 (new format)
	8.03 22.02.14-01 (new format)
	
There are two different version number formats, the deprecated one is not used after December 2021, new format is more easy to understand. TROIA Platform version numbers are consisted from two main parts "major version number" and "build number", in new format build number is in YY.MM.DD-NN format(YY:two digit year, MM:two digit month, DD:two digit day, NN:two digit number of version on a single day). It is obvious that version numbers are ordered so you can compare between two dates to learn which version is older or younger.

602, 603, 604, 802, 803 are names **CANIAS ERP** versions and all are designed to run on a major TROIA Platform version. (602 works on 3.08.xx xxxxxx, 603 works on 5.01.xx xxxxxx, 604 works on 5.02.xx xxxxxx, 802 works on 8.02 YY.MM.DD-NN, 803 works on 8.03 YY.MM.DD-NN). So; 602, 603, 604, 802, 803 are not valid version names for TROIA Platform.
